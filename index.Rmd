Welcome to the Herbivory Variability Network ("HerbVar"). We are a global research network that aims to describe and understand how and why patterns in plant--herbivore interactions vary across the tree of life and around the world.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align='center', dpi=72}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/herb_collage.png")
```

Although we are a new network (founded in mid 2019), we already have more than 200 collaborators from more than 100 institutions across 30+ countries. Please email [Will Wetzel, Moria Robinson, or a member of the HerbVar Planning Group](leadership.html) if you are interested in joining us. We are always looking for additional collaborators, especially those who can contribute data from under-sampled regions or from new plant families or focal plant families and species.


Our growing dataset currently has **>700 surveys of >450 plant species from >130 plant families**. These are spread across North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, and we are working to expand our geographic extent.

d = data.frame(d)

mapWorld = borders("world", colour="gray80", fill="gray80") # create a layer of borders

```

The Herbivory Variability Network is run out of [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). Support and seed funding for coordination was provided by [MSU AgBioResearch](https://www.canr.msu.edu/research/), [MSU Department of Entomology](https://www.canr.msu.edu/ent/), [MSU CANR International Programs](https://www.canr.msu.edu/global/), and the [MSU Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Program](https://eeb.msu.edu/).
