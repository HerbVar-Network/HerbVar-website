Welcome to the Herbivory Variability Network ("HerbVar"). We are a global research network that aims to describe and understand how and why patterns in plant--herbivore interactions vary across the tree of life and around the world.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/herb_collage.png")
```

Although we are a new network (founded in mid 2019), we already have 100+ collaborators from more than 60 institutions across 23 countries. Please email [Will Wetzel, Moria Robinson, or a member of the HerbVar Planning Group](leadership.html) if you are interested in joining us. We are always looking for additional collaborators, especially those who can contribute data from under-sampled regions or from new plant families or focal plant families and species.


Our growing dataset currently has >190 surveys, including >160 plant species from >60 plant families. These are spread across North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, and we are working to expand our geographic extent.
