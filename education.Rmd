We are forming a team to advance how the concept of variability is taught in biology. If you're interested, please get in touch with Nora Underwood (nunderwood@bio.fsu.edu), the team leader. One part of this effort is to collect and share educational materials on variability. They are available to our [Eduational-Materials repository on GitHub](https://github.com/HerbVar-Network/Educational-Materials), a public repository. But please note that this is still a work in progress.
