HerbVar was founded by the [Wetzel Lab at Michigan State University](https://WetzelLab.com). It is led by a Planning Group and multiple Subgroups that focus on specific topics. Please feel free to email members of the Planning Group or Coordination Staff if you are interested in the project. For information on how our network runs, please see the [HerbVar Document of Collaboration](/protocols/HerbVar Document of Collaboration.pdf).
