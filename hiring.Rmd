## Postdoctoral scholar

The Herbivory Variability Network and [The Wetzel Lab at Michigan State University](https://wetzellab.com) invite applications for a postdoc scholar to serve as a research leader and a coordinator in The Herbivory Variability Network (HerbVar).

HerbVar is an NSF-funded Research Coordination Network (RCN) with the goal of bringing together scientists from around the world to understand how plant-herbivore interactions vary across the planet, across ecosystems, and across the plant phylogeny. A major focus of the project is variability itself. We aim to understand what leads some plant populations to have high variability and others to have lower variability in their interactions with herbivores.

The postdoc would analyze data, write papers, give presentations, help set synthesis and analysis priorities, organize working groups, participate in network activities, and assist with central network coordination. The postdoc could focus on any one or more of our RCN research objectives: (1) synthesizing ideas and existing data (including our dataset with 750+ herbivory surveys), (2) developing a statistical toolbox and theory for studying interaction variability, and (3) coordinating globally distributed data collection.

Desirable qualifications include experience working collaboratively, experience leading group science or synthesis, strong skills in statistics and data science, and experience with the ecology and/or evolution of plants and/or herbivores. The initial appointment is for one year with potential for renewal for a total of 2-3 years. Remote work is a possibility, although in-person network meetings will be required 1-3 times per year.

Candidates should submit (preferably in one doc) (1) cover letter describing research interests and career goals, including a description of your interest or experience in fostering an inclusive environment, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) names and contact information for three references, and (4) two publications. Review of applications will begin in September 2022 and continue until a suitable candidate is found. Please email wcwetzel@msu.edu with questions.

## Data science research technician

The Herbivory Variability Network and [The Wetzel Lab at Michigan State University](https://wetzellab.com) invite applications for a data science research technician. The research technician would serve as a data scientist, a database developer and manager, and a leader and coordinator within the network. The research technician will use data science and team science skills to help coordinate the management of the network, including development and dissemination of field protocols, network communication, and database management. This is an exciting opportunity to work with a dynamic and growing research group. Duties will include managing and tidying network data, receiving and integrating new data submissions from collaborators, exporting data from our database for analyses, assisting with data science and statistical analyses, helping to coordinate working groups, disseminating network materials, facilitating the team science we do, and responding to collaborator inquiries.

HerbVar is an NSF-funded Research Coordination Network (RCN) with more than 200 members from 30+ counties. We have the goal of bringing together scientists from around the world to understand how plant-herbivore interactions vary across the planet, across ecosystems, and across the plant phylogeny. A major focus of the project is variability itself. We aim to understand what leads some plant populations to have high variability and others to have lower variability in their interactions with herbivores.

Deadline for application is listed as July 12, at which point initial screening will being. However, the position will remain open until filled, so please apply even after the listed deadline. Please feel free to get in touch if youâ€™re interested (wcwetzel@msu.edu). The initial position is for one year with potential for renewal depending on performance. Remote work is a possibility, although in-person network meetings will be required 1-3 times per year.

Required Education/Experience/Skills:
Knowledge equivalent to a B.S. degree in ecology, data science, or a related field; six months of experience; strong experience with the R programming language; strong communication skills; or an equivalent combination of education and experience. 

Desired:
M.S. degree in ecology, data science, or a related field; experience facilitating team science; experience with collaborative coding; excellent organizational and communication skills; experience with data cleaning and management; knowledge of the ecology of plants and/or herbivores; passion for science and creativity in the face of obstacles.
