The Herbivory Variability Network has [standardized protocols for surveying herbivore damage](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/) on plants around the world and across the tree of life. Members contributing data to the HV database need to use these standardized protocols to ensure their data conform to our methods. We encourage all plant-herbivore researchers to use the protocols as well to help make data comparable across studies. 

_**Before you start collecting data, we strongly recommend you review the manual to develop an understanding of the motivations and structure of the project**_. For example, an overview of the project can be found in [Chapter 1](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/01_intro/intro.html), and our network structure is described in [Chapter 2](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/01_intro/Network_Structure.html).  


An overview of the Protocols is available [here](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/04_protocols/protocols_overview.html). There you can find links to the following protocols:  

1. The _Primary Protocol_ for selecting plants and surveying leaf damage. See also our _Guide to Estimating Damage_ for detailed methods and tips for quantifying damage
2. _Reproductive Damage_ Protocol

3. _Alternate Protocols_ for:  
    i) Low Density/Low Abundance Plants  
    ii) Cacti & Succulents  
    iii) Large Trees   
    iv) Rhizomatous Geophytes  
    v) Quantifying Herbivores   

There are also chapters with [_datasheets_](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/05_forms/forms_list.html) and [field guides](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/05_forms/forms_list.html).



The entire manual -- including data sheets, protocols, and field guides -- is [available for download as a PDF](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/herbvar-manual.pdf).
