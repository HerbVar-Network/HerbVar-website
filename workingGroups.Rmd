Below is a list of our current and proposed Working Groups, organized by authorship model. Each includes a brief description with a link to a PDF document with more information. Please see the [HerbVar Manual chapter on paper working group proposals](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/collaboration/working-group-pubs.html) for details on how to propose new Working Groups. Or if you are interesting in proposing a new, add-on data collection effort, please see the [HerbVar Manual chapter on proposing new data collection](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/collaboration/new_data_collection.html).

# Open Working Groups

These Working Groups include all Site PIs who contributed relevant data, or they are open to any member who wants to join. Leads will reach out to involve co-authors.


### Spatial Pattern in Herbivory Working Group

- Is herbivory contagious? The spatial pattern of herbivore damage within plant populations across the globe
- Lead: William Wetzel, Montana State University
- Co-authors: All relevant HV Site PIs will be included. This includes all members who contributed data to our 2023 Science paper.

### Focal Family Working Group

- Examining patterns of herbivory within our focal families
- Lead: N. Ivalu Cacho, Institute of Biology, UNAM
- Co-authors: All relevant HV Site PIs who contributed focal family data will be included as co-authors.

### Education Working Group

- The HerbVar Education Working Group aims to help faculty teach undergraduates about variability-based issues of scientific and social importance, and to provide research training for graduate students and postdocs that will support future variability-based research
- Lead: Nora Underwood, Florida State University
- Co-leads: TBD
- Other members: Open to new members, please get in touch with Nora Underwood (nunderwood@bio.fsu.edu)

# Newly proposed Working Groups

If you are interested in proposing a Working Group, please review the [HerbVar Manual](https://herbvar-network.github.io/herbvar_manual/). Working Groups can use existing data or design and implement new data collection protocols. Feel free to reach out to the Steering Committee if you have questions.

### Phytochemistry Working Group
- Relationship between plant chemistry and damage patterns
- Lead: Lee Dyer
- Co-leads: TBD
